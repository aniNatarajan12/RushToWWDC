# RushToWWDC


This is my entry to WWDC 18.
The playground is based on a young student who won a scholarship to WWDC. On the way there, the student is stopped by aliens and has to fight them off in order to get to WWDC in time.

**The playground uses ARKit so you have to run it on an iPad that is compatible**
