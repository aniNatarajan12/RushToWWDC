 **DISCLAIMER**
 
 This playground uses ARKit so it requires an iPad that is compatible. This playground will work on all iPad devices but is recommended to use the 9.7 or 10.5 inch devices due to the UI's layout.
 
 ### Welcome
 **Congrats!** After spending hours coding and debugging, you work has finally paid off - you won a scholarship to WWDC!

 You waited for months until it was finally time for WWDC. As you fall asleep, you dream about all of the cool things you will learn the next day.
 
 **RING! RING!** Your alarm goes off and you spring out of bed. WWDC is officially here. You quickly put your clothes on and nag your mom until she gets ready. However, things quickly take a turn ...
 
 While driving on the freeway, there is a complete standstill. Curious, you peek out of your window to see what's happening. Far in the distance, you see something flying in the air...
 
 ## ALIENS!
 If you want to get to WWDC in time, you know what must be done.
 
 
 Go to the [next](@next) page to save your trip to WWDC!
